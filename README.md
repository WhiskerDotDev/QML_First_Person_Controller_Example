# QML First Person Controller Example

This is a repo I made in preparation for Brackey's Game Jam to experiment with 3D and FP(First Person) controls. This repo will most probably be updated consistently. This will NOT be my submitted game, but only practice to hone my skills.

As per the MIT License, feel free to use this code in your own projects involving QML, which although an uncommon platform for 3D games, I'd like to give it a shot regardless :D

# Capabilities

The capabilties it can do so far are:
  -Look around using the mouse
  -read and modify mouse position via the appropriate Class
The capabilities I hope to add very soon are:
  -movement using WASD keys,
  -jumping
