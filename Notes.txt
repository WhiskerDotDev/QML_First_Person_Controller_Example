basic Camera Controller Idea:

Use Mouse Deltas.

Limit the Pitch (vertical) to 90 and -90 (all the way up and down)

Do NOT Limit the Yaw (horizontal)

Use Doubles/Reals for both values.

So, I might have to define:

a Mouse Area

The current cursor position

at each update:

calculate the delta of the cursor position vertically and horizontally, then divide these values by 90 (for vertical axis) and 360 (?) for the horizontal axis.

For Horizontal axis, assuming mouse starts at 0,0 and then translates to 100, 0 that is a translation of 100 px.

100/360 = 0.27777

Which if we were to multiply by 360 it would just give us 100 degrees of rotation, but we have a sensitivity value. So multiplying that value by sensitivity and then 360 would give us our rotation value. Which we would simply have to add to the current euler rotation of the camera.

However,




Timer{
id: tickTimer
interval: (100) //Timer Has interval of 1/60 (I.e.  our tick)
running: true; //Timer runs.

onTriggered: {
moveMyCursor(half_width, half_height); //Move cursor to the center, works

difference_vertical += (half_height  -= screenArea.mouseY);
difference_horizontal += (half_width -= screenArea.mouseX);
    difference_horizontal = Math.max(-89, Math.min(89, difference_horizontal));
myCam.eulerRotation = 10;
myCam.eulerRotation.X += (difference_vertical *= sensitivity)
myCam.eulerRotation.Y+= (difference_horizontal *= sensitivity)
    difference_horizontal  == 0.0;
    difference_vertical  == 0.0;
}
repeat: true
}
